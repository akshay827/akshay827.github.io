Hello, there. I am a full-time software developer at Nagarro. My current role involves working at the client's location where I design, develop, and maintain the OpenAPI solutions for one of the leading Danish investment bank.

During my time of undergraduate studies (2016-20), I gained valuable exposure to A.I. while working on a wide range of research projects and publishing my work in reputable academic journals. If you'd like to learn more, please head over to my Google Scholar profile.

In my free-time, I try to read books, learn about new stuff (can be anything - astronomy, history, geopgraphy, philosophy, ..., anything.), watch random YouTube videos about existential crises (Kurzgesagt, I see you), or just go outside for a walk. I also love to discuss new ideas, so please feel free to connect with me through any medium you prefer. 

Thanks for stopping by, and have a good one.
